# SKIDLAB :: Vault33 Tactical Toolkit

**Repo Type:** Field-Ready Payload & Utility Scripts  
**Terminal Node:** HYPR-LITE  
**Vault Registration:** V33-HYPR

---

## 📜 Lore
> Recovered from the pre-war ruins of a Vault-Tec sanctioned Sony VAIO facility, the HYPR-LITE terminal was repurposed by Vault33 operatives to serve as a mobile, self-sufficient adversarial emulator and payload delivery system. 
>
> SKIDLAB is the kit drop. The toolbox. The vault’s unsanctioned response to sanitized cyber hygiene. When digital chaos needs to be weaponized in a training environment, SKIDLAB delivers.
